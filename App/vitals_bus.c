 * @file    vitals_bus.c
 * @brief   YOUR FILE — the sensor bus IO layer (refer to vitals_bus.h for
 *          the concept).
 *
 *          SWEN 563 / CMPE 663 — P2 "DG-30 DecuGuard" starter.
 *
 *  WHAT YOU WRITE HERE (spec R3/R4/R13 groundwork):
 *
 *   1. The five IO callbacks that each component driver needs.
 *      STTS22H_IO_t and ISM330DHCX_IO_t give their shapes. Read the
 *      headers in Drivers/Components, because they ARE the documentation.
 *        - Init:     nothing to do, because CubeMX ran MX_I2C3_Init()
 *                    before your code starts. Return 0. (RegisterBusIO
 *                    refuses a NULL pointer.)
 *        - DeInit:   also a no-op that returns 0.
 *        - ReadReg:  HAL_I2C_Mem_Read (&hi2c3, DevAddr, Reg,
 *                    I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_8BIT, pData, Len, timeout). Map
 *                    HAL_OK to 0, and map each other value to -1.
 *        - WriteReg: HAL_I2C_Mem_Write, with the same mapping.
 *        - GetTick:  (int32_t)HAL_GetTick().
 *      The IO struct of the IMU has one more member, Delay. Connect it to
 *      a HAL_Delay wrapper. The ST BSP forgets this member, and a garbage
 *      function pointer is a defect, also while no code calls it today.
 *
 *   2. vitals_bus_init(), for each sensor:
 *        a. fill the IO struct. The Address comes from the component
 *           header (STTS22H_I2C_ADD_H / ISM330DHCX_I2C_ADD_H). The DK
 *           straps the two address pins high. These are 8-bit forms, so
 *           give them to the driver without a change,
 *        b. <sensor>_RegisterBusIO(),
 *        c. <sensor>_ReadID() and CHECK the id (STTS22H_ID /
 *           ISM330DHCX_ID). Report a mismatch by name with printf and
 *           return a negative value (R3),
 *        d. <sensor>_Init(), then TEMP_Enable or ACC_Enable. The drivers
 *           power up DISABLED, and no data streams before you enable one,
 *        e. set the rates with STTS22H_TEMP_SetOutputDataRate(
 *           &temp_sensor, 1.0f). The IMU default after ACC_Enable is
 *           104 Hz at ±2 g, which is correct for R4.
 *
 *  Check your work with the D2 demo row. POST must print the two WHO_AM_I
 *  ids. Then single-step ONE ReadReg call down into HAL_I2C_Mem_Read, and
 *  see that it uses the same I2C3 registers that you programmed by hand
 *  in P1. That path, from your call down to the registers and back, is
 *  the point of this project.
